# Sum TDD

A Flutter project demonstrating Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles through the implementation of the String Calculator kata.

## About This Project

This project is designed to showcase TDD methodology by implementing the famous **String Calculator** kata by Roy Osherove. The goal is to demonstrate how TDD guides development through incremental, test-first coding practices.

## What is TDD?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where:
1. Write a failing test first
2. Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. Refactor the code while keeping tests green

## String Calculator Kata

This implementation follows the String Calculator kata requirements:
- Create a simple string calculator with an `Add(string numbers)` method
- Handle empty strings, single numbers, and comma-separated values
- Support different delimiters and various edge cases
- Practice incremental development through TDD
